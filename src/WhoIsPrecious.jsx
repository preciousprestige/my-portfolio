               <strong>Hey, Precious here...</strong> 
               </p>
            <p>
a software developer and creative mind. With a strong foundation in React, React Native, and other web technologies, I blend design and code to build digital experiences that speak deeply
            </p>
            <p>
                 Always evolving and innovative. Walk with me....</p>
           <p>   I relocated to Manila to pursue a degree in Information Technology majoring in mobile, web and software development at Trinity University of Asia.
              I design minimalist, aesthetic websites for creative organizations and individuals, using the power of design to communicate effectively without complexity.
               interned at the ICTO at Trinity University of Asia, where I strengthened my skills in React, contributing, building, and maintaining in-house websites.
               worked as a Front-end engineer for a  couple growth-stage start-ups using React to develop the user interface for users, admin, and mobile site.
            </p>
            <p>This page archives a slice of who I am‚Äîplayful, thoughtful, and intentional. A little godly corner of the internet. Stay awhile.</p>
